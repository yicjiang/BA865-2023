They have asked you to provide a predictive model that can accurately predict how long a given bike rental will last, at the time the rental begins. The use case is that the bike share company wants to be able to predict how long a customer will have the bike in their possession, when they begin their retnal, in order to better manage operational efficiency across the bike network. Note that when the customer initiates a bike rental, they enter the starting station ID and ending station ID for their trip, into the mobile app."],"metadata":{"id":"fxAF2jbRA3WY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sMblm7NpWSY9"},"source":["# *Name: (Student Name Here)*\n","# *Email: (Student Email Here)*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jF365-n0EC-q"},"source":["#*Import and Pre-process Data*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"a2ab2j0wz3oA"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","bluebikes = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gburtch/BA865-2023/main/Lecture%20Materials/C_Assignment/bluebikes_sample.csv')\n","\n","# This function MUST return a pair of objects (predictors, labels, in that order) as numpy arrays.\n","def processData(data):\n","    \n","    # pre-process your data here, and return your two numpy arrays...\n","\n","    return train_predictors, train_labels\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vhnwnEtEOeXd"},"source":["#*Specify Your Neural Network Architecture, Process Your Sample*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8KZXFE1fWMcj"},"source":["Calling the data pre-processing function on the sample."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"HToKOpiSoZmf"},"outputs":[],"source":["predictors, labels = processData(bluebikes)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RGYaiNdpoako"},"source":["Specifying my Neural Network's structure.
